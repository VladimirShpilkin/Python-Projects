# Netflix-Movies
Test project on the duration of the Netflix movies in the last years. The goal of the research was to find out, whether the movies are getting shorter or longer. Moreover, it was also needed to find out, which types of movies are the shortest of all and if there is any correlation between the movie type and its length.
